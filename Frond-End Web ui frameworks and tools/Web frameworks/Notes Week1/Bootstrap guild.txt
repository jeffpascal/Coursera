Bootstrap makes available four classes

-xs extra small
-sm small
-md medium screens
-lg for large screens

col-sm-5  -- occupies 5 columns


If the screens are XS then they appear as 12 columns each div so col-xs-12 is used.
<div class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-5">
<div class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-5">


If the screens are SM or BIGGER then they appear as 5 columns each div so col-sm-5 is used.
<div class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-5">   <div class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-5">
